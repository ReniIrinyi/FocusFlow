# CareFlow App - Build and Deployment Guide

This README provides a quick overview of how to clone the CareFlow repository, build it into an executable JAR, and deploy it to different environments (e.g., test and production).

---

## 1. Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CareFlow.git
cd CareFlow
```
Replace `yourusername/CareFlow.git` with the actual repository URL.

---

## 2. Building the JAR File

1. **Create a JAR Artifact**  
   - In your IDE, go to **File → Project Structure → Artifacts**.  
   - Create a JAR artifact (e.g., `<ArtifactName>`).  
   - Specify the path to the main class (e.g., `Main.kt`).

2. **Include Resources**  
   - Place your CSS files, `.txt` files, and any other resources into the `resources` folder so they will be automatically included in the JAR.

3. **Build the JAR**  
   - In your IDE, select **Build → Build Artifacts → <ArtifactName> → Build**.  
   - The generated JAR will typically appear in:
     ```
     out/artifacts/<ArtifactName>
     ```
   - This JAR contains all classes and resources required to run the application.

---

## 3. Deployment Steps

1. **Test Environment**  
   - Run the generated JAR locally or on a test server:
     ```bash
     java -jar <ArtifactName>.jar
     ```
   - Confirm that configuration files (e.g., `application.properties`) and environment variables are correct.

2. **Production Environment**  
   - Copy or upload the JAR file to your production server.
   - Adjust all production-specific settings (database URL, credentials, ports, etc.).
   - Launch the JAR:
     ```bash
     java -jar <ArtifactName>.jar
     ```

3. **Monitoring & Maintenance**  
   - Watch the application logs for errors or warnings.
   - Restart or update the service as needed.

**Note:**  
Adjust repository URL, file paths, and artifact names as appropriate for your specific environment.
